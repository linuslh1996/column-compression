# Column-Compression

## Interesting Links
- [Overview](https://upscaledb.com/0009-32bit-integer-compression-algorithms.html) Upscaledb tried out different integer compression approaches and benchmarked them. Interesting as a short and well written introduction.
- [github-link](https://github.com/lemire) This professor apparently has developed almost all of the popular integer compression libraries :D

# Column-Compression

## Interesting Links
- [Overview](https://upscaledb.com/0009-32bit-integer-compression-algorithms.html) Upscaledb tried out different integer compression approaches and benchmarked them. Interesting as a short and well written introduction.
- [This](https://github.com/lemire) professor apparently has developed almost all of the popular integer compression libraries :D Interesting to me are:
- [Masked VByte](https://github.com/lemire/MaskedVByte)
- [StreamVByte](https://github.com/lemire/streamvbyte) apparently very fast
- [simdcomp](https://github.com/lemire/simdcomp) BinPacking (but not the most uptodate)
- [SIMDCOmpression](https://github.com/lemire/SIMDCompressionAndIntersection) Similar to FastPFOr and TurboPFOr I think, but is optimized for sorted integers
